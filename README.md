# PyDbug
Debugging is the process of identifying and correcting current and potential faults (often referred to as "bugs") in software code that could cause it to behave improperly or crash. Debugging is a technique for detecting and correcting flaws or faults in software or systems so that they do not malfunction. Debugging gets more difficult when numerous subsystems or modules are tightly coupled, as each modification in one module may cause more bugs to appear in another.

Adding some spice on debugging will attract the students and help them to be more interested and excited by means of having a game that aims to enhance their debugging fluency without the feeling of stress and replaced it with enjoyment.

Students can now practice their debugging skills by playing this game. It is a web game that is accessible anytime and anywhere through the internet. By doing that, we can finally help the students to be more interested in programming and to be more passionate.
